# Customer Segmentation & Predictive Modeling for Product Buying Patterns

This project aims to delve deep into the purchasing behavior of Straumann's customers. The primary objectives include:
### Identification of Buying Patterns: 
Understand and classify the purchasing behavior of customers by analyzing past transaction data. This involves identifying products frequently bought together and determining typical customer preferences.
### Predictive Modeling: 
Develop advanced data models to predict future buying behaviors. These models will not only forecast what products customers are likely to purchase but also suggest complementary products that could be bundled or recommended.
### Actionable Insights for Marketing:
Provide insights that allow the marketing team to target customers more effectively with tailored campaigns. The aim is to boost the success of cross-selling and up-selling strategies by focusing on the right products for the right customers.
